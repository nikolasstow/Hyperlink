# Hyperlink for Effect

**Define once. Run anywhere. `yield*` everywhere.**

An Effect Service lives in one runtime. A *Hyperlink Service* is still a Service, same Tag,
same `yield*`, but its Contract is schema-typed, so the seam can sit between processes, not just
modules. You define it once; you decide later whether it runs in-process, on another core, or across
the network. The call site does not change.

What you `yield*` is a typed **Handle**: call methods, observe live state, steer the service at
runtime. Local and remote are the same type. Change the Contract and TypeScript flags every caller
in every process that imports the Tag.

Same Tag, two runtimes:

## Two runtimes, one program

A worker drains a queue; a scheduler fills it. Two runtimes, one Tag, no hand-rolled client on the
scheduler side.

Define two HyperServices: a priority queue and a scheduled daemon (included factories, used here as
the demo):

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as WorkPool from "hyperlink-ts/WorkPool"
import * as Daemon from "hyperlink-ts/Daemon"
import { Schema } from "effect"
const EmailJob = Schema.Struct({ to: Schema.String })
// ---cut---
class Emails extends WorkPool.Service<Emails>()("app/Emails", { payload: EmailJob }) {}
class Digest extends Daemon.Service<Digest>()("app/Digest") {}
```

Same-machine, nameless: `Node.unix` mints a Node when you omit one (no `Node.Service`, no path, no port).
Discovery is built in:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as WorkPool from "hyperlink-ts/WorkPool"
import * as Node from "hyperlink-ts/Node"
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"
const EmailJob = Schema.Struct({ to: Schema.String })
class Emails extends WorkPool.Service<Emails>()("app/Emails", { payload: EmailJob }) {}
declare const sendEmail: (job: typeof EmailJob.Type) => Effect.Effect<void>
// ---cut---
const worker = Node.unix([
  WorkPool.serve(Emails, { effect: sendEmail }),
])
```

The scheduler dials the same Tag, still `yield* Emails`:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as Daemon from "hyperlink-ts/Daemon"
import * as WorkPool from "hyperlink-ts/WorkPool"
import * as Hyperlink from "hyperlink-ts/Hyperlink"
import * as Polling from "hyperlink-ts/Polling"
import { Effect, Duration, Layer, Schema } from "effect"
const EmailJob = Schema.Struct({ to: Schema.String })
class Emails extends WorkPool.Service<Emails>()("app/Emails", { payload: EmailJob }) {}
class Digest extends Daemon.Service<Digest>()("app/Digest") {}
declare const nextEmail: Effect.Effect<typeof EmailJob.Type>
// ---cut---
const scheduler = Daemon.layer(Digest, {
  effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
    const emails = yield* Emails   // same Handle type as local
    const email = yield* nextEmail
    yield* emails.add(email)
  }),
  polling: Polling.spaced(Duration.hours(1)),
}).pipe(Layer.provide(Hyperlink.unix(Emails)))
```

`Digest` runs on the scheduler, `Emails` on the worker, yet `emails.add(…)` looks like one process.
**Two HyperServices, two runtimes, one program.** Named Node: `Node.unix(Worker, …)` pairs with
`Hyperlink.unix(Worker)`. Nameless: `Node.unix([serve…])` pairs with `Hyperlink.unix(Tag)`.

When you need another machine (or a browser), step up to HTTP. Same worker, same Tag; only the listen
changes:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as WorkPool from "hyperlink-ts/WorkPool"
import * as Node from "hyperlink-ts/Node"
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"
const EmailJob = Schema.Struct({ to: Schema.String })
class Emails extends WorkPool.Service<Emails>()("app/Emails", { payload: EmailJob }) {}
declare const sendEmail: (job: typeof EmailJob.Type) => Effect.Effect<void>
// ---cut---
const worker = Node.http(
  WorkPool.serve(Emails, { effect: sendEmail }),
  3001,
)
```

The scheduler dials with `Hyperlink.connect(Emails, Hyperlink.protocolHttp(3001))`. Move a runtime to
another machine and only the address changes. Day to day, prefer `Node.http` / `Node.ws`; the full
Layer vocabulary (including escape hatches) is in [Managing Layers](/docs/managing-layers).

## The same Handle steers it

Callable across runtimes is half the product. The Handle is also **operable** across them (pause,
depth, live events) from anywhere the Tag is reached:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as WorkPool from "hyperlink-ts/WorkPool"
import { Effect, Stream, Schema } from "effect"
const EmailJob = Schema.Struct({ to: Schema.String })
class Emails extends WorkPool.Service<Emails>()("app/Emails", { payload: EmailJob }) {}
declare const onChange: (e: unknown) => Effect.Effect<void>
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
// ---cut---
const emails = yield* Emails            // local OR remote: same type

yield* emails.pause                     // stop draining, at runtime
const depth = yield* emails.size.get    // how many waiting, right now
yield* emails.events.pipe(Stream.runForEach(onChange))
// ---cut-after---
})
```

A **CLI**, **TUI**, or **web** dashboard rides that same Tag. None of them need a second client, and
none of them touch the Implementation.

## Build your own

`Emails` and `Digest` are not special cases. Every Hyperlink Service is a **Contract** plus an
**Implementation**. You use that primitive directly:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as Hyperlink from "hyperlink-ts/Hyperlink"
import { Schema } from "effect"
// ---cut---
class Counter extends Hyperlink.Service<Counter>()("app/Counter", {
  value: Hyperlink.ref(Schema.Number),
  increment: Hyperlink.effectFn({ by: Schema.Number }),
  reset: Hyperlink.effect(Schema.Void),
}) {}
```

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as Hyperlink from "hyperlink-ts/Hyperlink"
import { Effect, Schema, SubscriptionRef } from "effect"
class Counter extends Hyperlink.Service<Counter>()("app/Counter", {
  value: Hyperlink.ref(Schema.Number),
  increment: Hyperlink.effectFn({ by: Schema.Number }),
  reset: Hyperlink.effect(Schema.Void),
}) {}
// ---cut---
const counterImpl = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const ref = yield* SubscriptionRef.make(0)
  return {
    value: Hyperlink.subscribable(ref),
    increment: ({ by }: { by: number }) => SubscriptionRef.update(ref, (n) => n + by),
    reset: SubscriptionRef.set(ref, 0),
  }
})
```

Same Tag, three placements (in-process, served, or connected):

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as Hyperlink from "hyperlink-ts/Hyperlink"
import * as Node from "hyperlink-ts/Node"
import { Effect, Schema, SubscriptionRef } from "effect"
class Counter extends Hyperlink.Service<Counter>()("app/Counter", {
  value: Hyperlink.ref(Schema.Number),
  increment: Hyperlink.effectFn({ by: Schema.Number }),
  reset: Hyperlink.effect(Schema.Void),
}) {}
const counterImpl = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const ref = yield* SubscriptionRef.make(0)
  return {
    value: Hyperlink.subscribable(ref),
    increment: ({ by }: { by: number }) => SubscriptionRef.update(ref, (n) => n + by),
    reset: SubscriptionRef.set(ref, 0),
  }
})
// ---cut---
Hyperlink.layer(Counter, counterImpl)                            // in-process
Node.http(Hyperlink.serve(Counter, counterImpl), 4000)           // served over RPC
Hyperlink.connect(Counter, Hyperlink.protocolHttp(4000))         // from another runtime
```

Operability and dashboard slots come with the Contract. Walk through this end to end in
[Creating a Hyperlink Service](/docs/creating-a-hyperlink).

## Working with peers

The same Tag can reach its **peers** (other instances of itself) and coordinate. Sessions sharded
across droplets: each Node holds what it owns; a lookup for someone else's session is **forwarded to
the owner**. [`ShardMap`](/docs/shardmap) is that pattern as an included HyperService factory:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as ShardMap from "hyperlink-ts/ShardMap"
import * as Hyperlink from "hyperlink-ts/Hyperlink"
import * as Node from "hyperlink-ts/Node"
import { Schema } from "effect"
class DropletEast extends Node.Service<DropletEast>()("app/DropletEast") {}
class DropletWest extends Node.Service<DropletWest>()("app/DropletWest") {}
class DropletCentral extends Node.Service<DropletCentral>()("app/DropletCentral") {}
const SessionId = Schema.String
const Session = Schema.Struct({ id: SessionId, userId: Schema.String })
// ---cut---
class Sessions extends ShardMap.Service<Sessions>()("app/Sessions", {
  key: SessionId,
  value: Session,
  keyOf: (s) => s.id,
}).pipe(
  Hyperlink.nodes([DropletEast, DropletWest, DropletCentral]),
) {}
```

Serve a droplet (local shard plus peer clients) from one materialization:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as ShardMap from "hyperlink-ts/ShardMap"
import * as Hyperlink from "hyperlink-ts/Hyperlink"
import * as Node from "hyperlink-ts/Node"
import { Layer, Schema } from "effect"
class DropletEast extends Node.Service<DropletEast>()("app/DropletEast") {}
class DropletWest extends Node.Service<DropletWest>()("app/DropletWest") {}
class DropletCentral extends Node.Service<DropletCentral>()("app/DropletCentral") {}
const SessionId = Schema.String
const Session = Schema.Struct({ id: SessionId, userId: Schema.String })
class Sessions extends ShardMap.Service<Sessions>()("app/Sessions", {
  key: SessionId,
  value: Session,
  keyOf: (s) => s.id,
}).pipe(
  Hyperlink.nodes([DropletEast, DropletWest, DropletCentral]),
) {}
// ---cut---
const east = Node.http([ShardMap.serve(Sessions)], 3001).pipe(
  Layer.provide(Hyperlink.peersLayer(Sessions, DropletEast)),
)
```

From any Node, a caller reads through the Tag; ownership and the hop stay inside the HyperService:

{.twoslash}
``` ts
import * as ShardMap from "hyperlink-ts/ShardMap"
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"
const SessionId = Schema.String
const Session = Schema.Struct({ id: SessionId, userId: Schema.String })
class Sessions extends ShardMap.Service<Sessions>()("app/Sessions", {
  key: SessionId,
  value: Session,
  keyOf: (s) => s.id,
}) {}
declare const id: typeof SessionId.Type
// ---cut---
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const sessions = yield* Sessions
  const session = yield* sessions.get(id) // Option<Session> from whoever owns it
})
```

An unreachable owner degrades to a miss instead of blocking. **Every instance is an equal: reached,
and reaching others, through the same Tag.**

## Included Hyperlink Services

Building your own is the focus. The package also ships a few **included** Hyperlink Services you can
drop in when you need them:

- **[`WorkPool`](/docs/work-pools)**: priority work queue (enqueue, drain, dedup, retry, concurrency)
- **[`Daemon`](/docs/daemons)**: continuous or recurring work (polling, schedules, run history)
- **[`ShardMap`](/docs/shardmap)**: partitioned key/value across a fleet, with peer routing
- **[`Gate`](/docs/gates)**: concurrency and rate limits at the boundary
- **[`Telemetry`](/docs/telemetry)** · **[`FleetHealth`](/docs/fleet-health)**: glass over the mesh

## When the fleet has Lookup

Fixed `Hyperlink.nodes([…])` is enough for a known mesh. When **Lookup** owns placement
(exclusive brains, Directory advertise, Advice prefer, A→B cutover), start here:

| Need | Guide |
|------|-------|
| One brain, many hands | [Identity coordinator](/docs/identity-coordinator) |
| Sticky dial / stream gap / conflict / yield | [Policy](/docs/policy) |
| Fail-fast addressed clients | [Client verify](/docs/client-verify) |
| OS spawn → Ready → assume → exit | [Launcher](/docs/launcher) |
