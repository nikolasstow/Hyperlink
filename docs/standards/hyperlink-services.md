# Hyperlink Factories

How a HyperService is defined, served, and meshed across nodes. Covers the tag/layer split, the serve vocabulary, and multi-node meshing.

{#tag-is-contract-layer-is-runtime .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## The tag is the contract; the layer is the runtime

A HyperService splits cleanly in two. The **tag** carries the wire contract — the `payload` / `success` /
`error` schemas — and nothing else; it is the wire SSOT and the thing a client (even a browser)
imports. The **layer** carries the runtime — the `effect` worker, `polling`, optional
`Hyperlink.deferStart`. Never cross
them: schemas never move into layer config (that breaks the wire SSOT and RPC safety), and the worker
never moves onto the tag (that drags the engine into the light contract). Derived UI or observe
surfaces are helpers that take the tag (*Principles → Handles stay thin*), not methods on it.

``` ts
// contract — the wire schema, passed positionally
class Mail extends WorkPool.Service<Mail>()("@acme/Mail", Job) {}

// runtime — in the layer
WorkPool.layer(Mail, { effect: handleJob })
  .pipe(Hyperlink.deferStart) // optional — idle until `start`
```

``` ts
// ❌ bad — wire schema in the layer (no longer SSOT; client and server can disagree)
WorkPool.layer(Mail, { payload: Job, effect: handleJob })
```

{#positional-schema-args .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Pass tag schemas positionally when you can

When a tag needs only its wire schema, pass it **positionally** — it's the clearest form. Reach for
the `{ payload, success, error }` config object only when the tag carries more than one wire slot, or
extra configuration. `WorkPool` always takes the object, because its lane structure
(`laneCount`, `namedLanes`) lives on the tag alongside the payload.

``` ts
// ✅ single schema → positional
class Mail extends WorkPool.Service<Mail>()("@acme/Mail", Job) {}

// config object — more than one wire slot
class Ingest extends Daemon.Service<Ingest>()("app/Ingest", { success: Report, error: PullFailed }) {}

// untyped WorkPool — always the object; lane config rides on the tag
class Jobs extends WorkPool.priority<Jobs>()("@acme/Jobs", {
  payload: Job,
  laneCount: 4,
  namedLanes: { interactive: 0, standard: 2, batch: 3 },
}) {}
```

{#behaviour-via-piped-combinators .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Compose behaviour with piped combinators, not constructor flags

Optional behaviour — scheduling, readiness, distribution — is **piped onto** the HyperService, never
passed as a constructor flag. Each combinator is composable and independent, so the base stays small
and you add only what you need (this is *Principles → Don't fight the framework* in the concrete).

``` ts
// base tag runs immediately; add behaviour by piping
class Ingest extends Daemon.Service<Ingest>()("app/Ingest", { success: Report })
  .pipe(
    Daemon.schedule([Daemon.window(openAt, closeAt)]),  // when it may run
    Hyperlink.withReadiness(isWarm),                        // when it counts as ready
  ) {}
```

{#data-last-tag-duals-shallow .must appliesTo=src}
## Data-last tag duals must not constrain `Svc`-bearing tag unions

A combinator meant for `class X extends Tag<X>()(…).pipe(combinator(…))` must not constrain its
data-last `T` as `HyperlinkTag | NodeBoundTag`. Those types carry a default `Svc = ServiceOf<S, Self>`;
stock tsc expands that while `Self` is still being declared and hits **TS2589** (tsgo often stays
quiet — gate with **both**). Constrain `T` with a shallow brand that only needs the spec (the package
uses `PipeableTag = { readonly [specSym]: FlatSpec }` for `withReadiness` / `distributed`). `T` is
still inferred as the concrete tag, so `(tag: T) => T` preserves it.

``` ts
// ✅ shallow — PipeableTag / equivalent
<T extends PipeableTag>(…): (tag: T) => T

// ❌ deep — reopens TS2589 on node-bound class .pipe under stock tsc
<T extends HyperlinkTag<any, any, any> | NodeBoundTag<any, any, any, any>>(…): (tag: T) => T
```

{#polling-vs-schedule .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Polling and schedule are different questions — never conflate

Two independent axes govern a running Daemon:

- **The schedule** answers *whether* an instance should be running at all — it arms and disarms.
- **Polling** answers *how often* an already-armed instance repeats its tick.

A base `Daemon.Service` is always armed and runs immediately; `.pipe(Daemon.schedule([...]))` gates it
to windows, and seeding `Daemon.schedule([])` starts it disarmed. Polling (`Polling.spaced`, …) is
set separately in the layer. Don't reach for one to do the other's job.

``` ts
Daemon.layer(Ingest, {
  effect: pull,
  polling: Polling.spaced(Duration.seconds(30)),  // cadence — not "should it run"
})
```

{#default-queue-lean .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## The default queue stays lean; custom lanes are a separate type

The default `WorkPool` is exactly three lanes — high / normal / low — and stays that way. When
you need a different lane count or a weighted take, that is `WorkPool`, a **separate
type**, not a wider-shaped default queue. Its scheduling code is loaded only when selected (see
*Build & browser safety*), so the default queue never carries the weight of lane machinery it doesn't
use.

``` ts
// default — three fixed lanes; schema positional
class Mail extends WorkPool.Service<Mail>()("@acme/Mail", Job) {}

// custom — N named lanes, a distinct type; lane config forces the object form
class Jobs extends WorkPool.priority<Jobs>()("@acme/Jobs", {
  payload: Job,
  laneCount: 4,
  namedLanes: { interactive: 0, standard: 2, batch: 3 },
}) {}
```

{.note}
Two related facts live elsewhere: the `.Tag` class-extends form → *Public types*; durability is
presence-driven (`serviceOption`) → *Storage*.


{#same-code-local-or-remote .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## The same code runs local or remote

A HyperService is driven by the same `yield* Tag` whether it is in-process or served over RPC — only the
layer you provide differs. Never branch on local-vs-remote in a consumer. A field either behaves
identically in both, or its divergence surfaces as a type or dependency error — never a silent
same-looking-but-different (see *Principles → Fail loudly*).

{#serve-vocabulary .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Use the locked serve vocabulary

Four verbs, one axis — how a HyperService is made available:

- **`layer`** — local only.
- **`serve`** — local **and** served over RPC (the default for a node).
- **`serveRemote`** — served only, not runnable in-process (plain impl; `R` via handler requirements).
- **`client`** — a remote handle to a served HyperService.

Toolkit engines that build a Hyperlink `Driver` mount with **`Hyperlink.serveRemoteDriver`**
(preserves the driver's worker `R`). Apps call `Gate.serveRemote` / `Daemon.serveRemote` /
`WorkPool.serveRemote` — not the Driver helper — unless they are assembling a custom engine.

Transport is a **separate** line: `httpServer` / `http` / `connect`. `Http` appears **only**
there — the core verbs stay transport-agnostic, so the same HyperService can be served over any protocol.

{#serve-preserves-requirements .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Serve / listen / `*Server` preserve open `R` (and `E`)

Every HyperService may have requirements — including other HyperServices. Serve layers,
`Node.listen` / `unix` / `http` / `ws`, and `httpServer` / `wsServer` / `ipcServer` must **keep**
those channels open so callers `Layer.provide` dependencies outside. Closing `R` at the server
boundary is rejected. Shared deps: provide once onto the server. Mutually exclusive deps of the
same tag: `Layer.provide` onto each serve layer (see *Managing Layers*).

{#serve-through-spec-checked-forms .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Serve through the engine's spec-checked form, never a bare literal

Serve a HyperService through its engine form (`WorkPool.serve`, `Daemon.serve`) — these mount the
handlers **and** keep the worker or tick alive. `Hyperlink.serve` only mounts handlers; using it for a
WorkPool leaves the worker dead. Never hand-write a `{ tag, impl }` literal: it types as
`Record<string, unknown>` and silently swallows typos — the engine form spec-checks the impl against
the tag.

{#provide-merge-serve-layers .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Put serve layers in the listen / `*Server` list; provide deps outside

`Node.http([...serveLayers], 3000)` / `Node.ws` / `httpServer` / `wsServer` union each layer's
requirement `R`, like `Layer.mergeAll`. Pass serves as the list argument (not a later bare
`Layer.provide` of a serve onto something that doesn't demand it — that prunes). Discharge deps with
`Layer.provide` / `provideMerge` **after** the server (shared) or on each serve layer (isolated).
Prefer `Node.http` / `Node.ws` (nameless + port / `":port"` / url shorthand) over `httpServer` /
`wsServer` when the battery localhost bind is enough.

``` ts
// ✅ good — serves in the list; shared dep outside
const live = Node.http([
  Hyperlink.serve(Counter, counterImpl),
  Hyperlink.serve(Mail, mailImpl),
], 3000).pipe(Layer.provide(Db.layer))

// ❌ bad — bare provide of a serve layer onto a program that doesn't require it prunes the mount
program.pipe(Layer.provide(Hyperlink.serve(Counter, counterImpl)))
```

{#declare-dont-provide-in-workers .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Declare dependencies in the worker; provide at the serve boundary

A worker or tick body **declares** its dependencies with `yield* Tag` — it never `Effect.provide`s
them inline. Provide **whole-service** deps once, at the serve/layer boundary, so
`strictEffectProvide` stays clean and the same body works local or served. Do **not** hoist a
**sub-effect-scoped** dep to `serve` — that widens `R` for the whole body; keep an app-local
scoping combinator beside the handler service — do not look for a package `locally` helper.

{#one-instance-one-materialization .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## One instance, one materialization

A HyperService is a single instance. Its local use and its served handlers share **one** materialization
— serving must not re-run the impl generator. Compose extra behaviour as post-construction
combinators (`withReadiness`, `distributed`) piped onto the HyperService, not as re-materializations or
baked constructor options (see *Principles → Don't fight the framework*).


{#one-service-n-instances .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## One HyperService = N node-local instances

One class. Each node runs its own instance; `peers` gives you the per-node handles.

``` ts
// one tag — not one-per-node
class Prices extends WorkPool.Service<Prices>()("app/Prices", Job) {}

const perNode = yield* Hyperlink.peers(Prices)
// { "node-a": handle, "node-b": handle, … } — keyed by node
```

{#readiness-per-node-local .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Readiness is per-node and local — never a cross-node hop

Readiness derives from a HyperService's **own** status and rolls up into that node's `/health`. Reaching
into a peer to decide your own readiness cascades one node's failure into its neighbours.

``` ts
// ✅ derived from this instance's own status
class Prices extends WorkPool.Service<Prices>()("app/Prices", Job)
  .pipe(Hyperlink.withReadiness((svc) =>
    Effect.map(svc.lifecycle.get, (s) => s._tag === "Running"),
  )) {}

// ❌ readiness that hops to peers — a down neighbour drags this node down
Hyperlink.withReadiness(() => Effect.map(Hyperlink.peers(Prices), allReady))
```

For a **stadium-board** view of the pack (Reachable / Unreachable), use
[`FleetHealth`](../guides/fleet-health.md) — a separate glass; do not stuff the fold into
`withReadiness`.

{#fold-over-leaf-fields .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Fold over leaf fields; fleet views stay out of the fan-out

`peers` fans out to leaf handles. A `fleet`-marked field is *already* a combined view, so it's
excluded from the fan-out — folding over it would re-aggregate an aggregate. Fold leaves, and add
your own node explicitly.

``` ts
// a combined field is marked fleet → not re-fanned-out by peers
class Prices extends WorkPool.Service<Prices>()("app/Prices", Job) {
  static readonly totalDepth = Hyperlink.fleet(Hyperlink.effect(Schema.Number))
}

// fold over leaves, self included explicitly (never silently)
const depthByNode = { ...(yield* Hyperlink.peers(Prices)), [self.key]: local }
```

{#peers-are-lazy .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Peers are lazy and degrade to a partial mesh

`peersLayer` never connects eagerly. No url ⇒ skip that peer, never throw. Urls come from the node or
`Config` — never frozen into the contract.

``` ts
Hyperlink.peersLayer(Prices, self, {
  nodes,
  url: (node) => Config.option(Config.string(`${node.key}_URL`)),
  //   Config.option → undefined skips a peer (partial mesh)
  //   a raw ConfigError fails the build loudly (misconfiguration)
})
```
