# Types & Naming

The type-level rules: making types true instead of asserting them, how everything is named, and how public shapes are declared.

{#fix-root-cause .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## No casts — fix the root cause structurally

No `as`, `as any`, `as unknown`, or `!` non-null assertions. When a type doesn't fit, change the
type — restructure the value, the signature, or the generic — until it does. A cast that "makes the
error go away" is a silent hole; the error was telling the truth.

``` ts
// ❌ bad — asserts the shape into existence
const cfg = input as QueueConfig

// ✅ good — the type is earned
const cfg = makeQueueConfig(payload, options)
```

{#narrow-with-validation .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Narrow with runtime validation, never an assertion

When a value arrives as `unknown` (wire input, config, JSON), narrow it by *checking* it — a
`Schema` decode or a type predicate — never by asserting. If a runtime value exists, it must be
validated, not assumed.

``` ts
// ❌ bad — unchecked; a malformed payload sails straight through
const item = raw as WorkItem

// ✅ good — validated; a bad payload fails loudly, typed
const item = yield* Schema.decodeUnknown(WorkItem)(raw)
```

{#correct-by-construction .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Correct by construction — verify, never assert

A value's type comes from a typed constructor, a decoder, a contract helper, or a named type it is
*checked against* — never from an assertion that can lie. `as` and `satisfies` are opposites, not a
pair: `as` **forces** a type regardless of the value, so a wrong `as` compiles and fails at runtime —
it stays banned (one exception — *A boundary cast is a last resort*). `satisfies` **verifies** a
value against a type *without widening it*, so a mismatch is a compile error and the narrow types
survive. `satisfies` is therefore allowed — but only against a **named** type, never an inline shape:
a `satisfies { … }` on an anonymous type means the contract has no home (*A config carries a named
type in its namespace*). For a shape that is shared or reused, reach for its constructor —
`Hyperlink.contract` / `Store.contract` are `<const S extends Spec>(s: S) => S`, so the spec is
checked, kept narrow, and shareable in one move.

``` ts
// ❌ as — forces the shape; a wrong value compiles and breaks at runtime
const lanes = value as WorkPool.Config

// ✅ satisfies a named type — verified, and the narrow literals survive
const lanes = {
  laneCount: 4,
  namedLanes: { interactive: 0, batch: 3 },
} satisfies WorkPool.Config
```

`as const` is unaffected — it is literal narrowing, not an assertion, and is always fine.

{#boundary-cast-last-resort .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## A boundary cast is a last resort — provably safe and justified

A cast is permitted **only** at the type-level boundary where TS genuinely cannot express a relation
*and* there is no runtime value to validate (pure HKT/builder erasure). Every such cast must be
**provably safe by construction** and carry a one-line comment stating *why* it holds. No bare
casts, no "it works" — the proof is the price of the cast. If a runtime value is in reach, this rule
does not apply; you validate instead of assert.

``` ts
// ✅ the only sanctioned form: provably safe, justified, no runtime value to check
// SAFE: `acc` is assembled field-by-field to satisfy Built<Self> across the chain below;
// TS can't track the accumulation through the builder. Nothing to validate at runtime.
return acc as Built<Self>
```

{#honest-error-types .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Type writes and failures honestly — never cast to `never`

An error channel is part of the type. Never widen a real failure away with `as never` or a `never`
return. A write that can fail is `Effect<…, StoreWriteError>`; casting it to `Effect<…, never>` is a
lie the caller pays for.

``` ts
// ❌ bad — claims it can't fail
append(row): Effect<void, never>

// ✅ good — the failure is typed and catchable
append(row): Effect<void, StoreWriteError>
```

{#extract-r-structurally .must appliesTo=src}
## Extract requirements structurally

Union a heterogeneous `R` by reading it off the implementation (`ServeRequirements<Impl>`), never by erasing
it. Never `as ServeEntry<never>`, never pin different entries to one `R`, never erase a precise
group type (`RpcGroupOf<S>`) down to `RpcGroup<any>` for assignability — that is the un-typed move
that hides a real mismatch.

{#classify-by-field-not-brand .must appliesTo=src}
## Classify by a structural field, never a brand

Detect leaf-vs-group (and kind generally) with a narrow, `F`-independent structural check — a `kind`
field — never a symbol brand or `extends AnyMethod`. No type-level branding. Owned `kind` string
values are PascalCase (*Owned string literals are PascalCase*).

``` ts
// ❌ bad — symbol brand / F-dependent test
if (node[groupSym]) { /* … */ }

// ✅ good — a plain structural discriminant (PascalCase owned string)
if (node.kind === "Group") { /* … */ }
```


{#pascalcase-types-only .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## PascalCase only for types, classes, and namespaces

PascalCase names a **binding** that is a class, a type, a namespace, or a namespace-member factory
(`Tag`, `Service`, `Schedule`). Nothing else among identifiers. If it's a value you can pass around,
its binding is not PascalCase — the sole exception is a factory that stands in for a namespace
member.

This rule is about **TypeScript names**, not string *contents*. Owned string literals
(`_tag`, modes, kinds, reasons) are PascalCase under *Owned string literals are PascalCase*.

{#namespaced-short-vs-internal-full .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Namespaced types are short; internal types use the full module prefix

Match Effect: under a public module namespace the member name is short; outside that namespace
(especially `src/internal/`) the name carries the module prefix so it stays unambiguous.

| Where | Form | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Public module (`src/WorkPool.ts`), consumed as `import * as WorkPool` | Short member | `WorkPool.PriorityConfig`, `WorkPool.Service` |
| `src/internal/*` (and any file that is **not** that namespace) | Full prefix | `WorkPoolPriorityConfig`, `WorkPoolPriorityHandle` |

``` ts
// ✅ public WorkPool.ts — short; consumers see WorkPool.PriorityConfig
export type PriorityConfig<T, E, R> = WorkPoolPriorityConfig<T, E, R>

// ✅ internal/workPoolPriority.ts — full name (no ambient WorkPool. namespace)
export type WorkPoolPriorityConfig<T, E, R> = …

// ❌ bad — short name orphaned in internal/
export type PriorityConfig<T, E, R> = …  // in src/internal/workPoolPriority.ts
```

The public file may **re-export** the internal full type under the short name (or define the short
alias there). Apps never import `src/internal/` directly.

{#values-are-camelcase .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Values are camelCase; UPPER_SNAKE only for magic constants

Every **value binding** is camelCase: layers, schemas, symbol consts, and ordinary module constants
and defaults. Reserve `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for the narrow set of fixed *magic* values Effect itself
uses it for — external-protocol codes, regex/pattern literals, spec URIs, and low-level algorithmic
magic numbers. A tunable default is a value, not a magic constant.

This is the name of the binding (`defaultPollMs`), not the casing inside string literals — see
*Owned string literals are PascalCase*.

``` ts
// ❌ bad — an ordinary default is just a value
export const DEFAULT_POLL_MS = 5_000
// ✅ good
export const defaultPollMs = 5_000

// ✅ fine — a fixed protocol code / pattern is genuinely magic; UPPER_SNAKE, as Effect does
const PARSE_ERROR_CODE = -32700
const STRING_PATTERN = /^[a-z]+$/
```

{#schema-value-vs-class .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## A schema value is camelCase; a schema class is PascalCase

A schema comes in two forms, and both honor the type/value split:

- A schema bound to a const (`Schema.Struct`, `Schema.Union`, …) is a **value** → camelCase; derive
  a PascalCase type alias when you need the type.
- A `Schema.Class` **is a class** → PascalCase, and it is value and type in one, so no separate
  alias.

``` ts
// value schema — camelCase value, PascalCase type derived from it
export const workItem = Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.String })
export type WorkItem = typeof workItem.Type

// class schema — PascalCase class, value + type in one
export class WorkItem extends Schema.Class<WorkItem>("WorkItem")({
  id: Schema.String,
}) {}
```

Both drop into any config that takes a schema — `payload` / `success` / `error` accept any
`Schema.Top`.

{#prefer-schema-class .should appliesTo="src examples"}
## Prefer a class schema when it earns its keep

Reach for a `Schema.Class` when a schema is **named, reused, carries behaviour, or wants a nominal
identity** — a payload, a response, a domain entity, an error. You get one name for the value and
the type, a validating constructor (`new WorkItem({…})`), `instanceof`, and room for methods. Keep a
plain struct value for **inline or anonymous** shapes, where a class is just ceremony.

{#layers-read-as-layers .should appliesTo="src examples"}
## Layers read as layers

Layers are camelCase. The canonical toolkit entrypoint is `layer` (and `layer*` variants like
`layerMemory`); a composed or auxiliary layer takes a `*Layer` suffix (`peersLayer`). Policy
modules use HttpApi-shaped constructables with Schema keys —
`class LookupPolicies extends PolicyBuilder.make(id).key(…)` — plural
constructable, singular module (`LookupPolicy` / `NodePolicy`); `defaultValue`
is the `Context.Reference` default. Key / `_tag` strings stay PascalCase; the
Def derives camelCase Layer methods via `Uncapitalize` (`"Sticky"` → `sticky`,
`"StreamGap"` → `streamGap`). Module re-exports those refs + helpers / mode
presets. Compose with dual `LookupPolicy.layer` / `LookupPolicy.provide` / product bag
`LookupPolicy.make({ StreamGap: "stall", … })`. Either way the name says "layer."

{#owned-string-literals-pascalcase .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Owned string literals are PascalCase

A string the package **owns** as a closed vocabulary is PascalCase: tagged-union `_tag`s, modes,
kinds, reasons, and the same class of discriminants elsewhere.

``` ts
// ✅ owned discriminants — prefer `_tag` for closed sums
{ readonly _tag: "Started" }
{ readonly _tag: "Memory" | "History" | "Waku" }   // Router.Service
{ readonly _tag: "Group" | "Leaf" | "LeafView" | "Health" } // Route.TargetValue
{ readonly reason: "Waiting" | "WaitInterrupted" }

// ❌ owned discriminants in other cases
{ readonly _tag: "started" }           // camel
{ readonly _tag: "memory" }            // lower
{ readonly reason: "wait-interrupted" } // kebab
{ readonly _tag: "gate.run.started" }  // dotted prefix
```

**Exception — preserve the referent.** When the string *is* or *embeds* something outside this
vocabulary, keep that thing's case:

| Referent | Keep as |
|----------|---------|
| URL / file path | `"/docs/work-pools"`, `"/health/*nodeId"` |
| Package / import / subpath | `"waku/router/client"`, `"hyperlink-ts/ui/Router/waku"` |
| Service / Context key already stamped | `"hyperlink-ts/WorkPool"`, `"app/Prices"` (see *Canonical ids*) |
| Env / config key | `"SERVICE_URL"`, `"HYPERLINK_ASSUME_TOKEN"` |
| DOM / HTML attribute | `"data-kind"`, `"aria-current"` |
| External protocol token | History `"push"` / `"replace"`, HTTP `"GET"` |
| Path-segment view on Target | `"logs"` / `"schedule"` / `"health"` (URL referent) |

Owning a *mode about* Waku still uses `"Waku"` on our `Service._tag`; the import path and optional
peer stay `"waku"`. Catalog route ids that become camelCase `urlBuilder` methods (`home`,
`nodeHealth`) follow *Values are camelCase* — they name bindings, not tag vocabularies.

{#discriminant-tags-pascalcase .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Discriminant tags are PascalCase

The `_tag` case of *Owned string literals are PascalCase*: `Started`, `Completed`, `Failed`,
`Interrupted` — never kebab, dotted prefixes, or a `Run*`-style prefix. Store state-transition
`reason` strings (`Waiting`, `WaitInterrupted`, …) follow the same rule. The tag names the case; it
reads like the variant it is.

{#canonical-ids-slash-scoped .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Canonical ids are slash-scoped

A service or contract id is a slash-separated, package-scoped string. **Preserve** the package name
and any path/folder segments as they exist on disk or in `exports`
(`hyperlink-ts`, `ui`, `Router/waku`). **Owned** type segments are PascalCase (`WorkPool`,
`HttpApiClient`, `Router`): `hyperlink-ts/WorkPool`, `hyperlink-ts/Gate/HttpApiClient`,
`hyperlink-ts/ui/Router`. (CLI and remote surfaces additionally accept normalized kebab suffix
aliases; an ambiguous suffix errors with the candidate list.)

{#name-for-what-it-is .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Name for what a thing is, not who uses it

A name describes the thing's own role, never a consumer's vocabulary. The package surface names
*serving* — it never borrows a downstream app's domain word (a queue is a `WorkPool`, not a
`SourceQueue` because one caller calls it a "source").


{#api-shapes-are-interfaces .must appliesTo=src}
## Public API shapes are hand-written `export interface`

An **API shape** is anything a consumer programs *against* — the object you pass in
(`ProcessMakeOptions`, `AcceleratingPollConfig`), the object you get back (`ProcessSnapshot`,
`HistoryStoreShape`), an options bag (`QueryOpts`), a service's method set. These are hand-written
`export interface`.

Why an interface, specifically:

- **It reads cleanly on hover.** An interface shows a consumer named fields; a schema-derived alias
  expands into `Schema.Struct<{…}>` machinery and buries the shape.
- **It's stable and documentable.** Each field takes a doc comment; the type is a fixed anchor, not
  a byproduct of whatever a schema currently infers.
- **It doesn't leak internals.** A `typeof schema.Type` drags the schema's encoding details into
  the public surface; an interface exposes only the contract.

``` ts
// ✅ good — explicit, documented, hover-friendly
export interface ProcessMakeOptions<E, RUser> {
  /** Poll cadence while the schedule is armed. */
  readonly polling?: PollingLayer
  readonly success?: Schema.Top
}

// ❌ bad — an API shape fabricated from a schema's inferred type
export type ProcessMakeOptions = typeof processMakeOptionsSchema.Type
```

A **sum type** is the one exception to "interface": a discriminated union is written `export type X
= A | B` over variant interfaces — still a hand-written contract, not a derived alias, and correct.
What this rule forbids is narrower — a schema-derived `typeof …Type` standing in for an API surface.

``` ts
// ✅ good — a sum type is a union of variant interfaces (as Option.Option is None | Some)
export type Connection = Connected | Disconnected
export interface Connected { readonly _tag: "Connected" }
export interface Disconnected { readonly _tag: "Disconnected"; readonly reason: string }
```

{.note}
This holds right up to the framework's own primitives: Effect's `Layer`, `Queue`, and `Cache` are
each `export interface`, and `Option` is an `export type` union of `Some` and `None` — never derived
types.

{#config-carries-a-named-type .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## A config carries a named type in its namespace

Every config, options, or input shape a consumer authors has a named type **exported from the
namespace it belongs to** — `WorkPool.Config`, `Daemon.Options` — a hand-written
`interface` (*Public API shapes are hand-written `export interface`*) attached in the same file with
`export declare namespace` (*Associated types attach in the same file*). The consumer builds the
value against it with `satisfies`: the named type is the contract, the shape is checked, and the
narrow types survive — and the type hovers as named fields, not `Schema.Struct<…>` machinery. Effect
names its configs the same way — `Pool.Config`, `Effect.Retry.Options`, `Logger.Options`.

``` ts
// src/WorkPool.ts — the type lives beside the namespace it configures
export declare namespace WorkPool {
  export interface Config {
    readonly laneCount: number
    readonly namedLanes: Record<string, number>
  }
}

// a consumer authors the config against the named type — no inline shape, no cast
const lanes = {
  laneCount: 4,
  namedLanes: { interactive: 0, batch: 3 },
} satisfies WorkPool.Config
```

{#schema-data-derives .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Schema-backed data derives its type from the schema

The counterpart — and the one place `typeof …Type` is *correct*. **Data** whose single source of
truth is a schema (events, payloads, wire records, metrics — anything encoded, decoded, or validated
by a `Schema`) takes its type *from* that schema. The schema already defines the shape for the wire;
hand-writing a parallel interface would duplicate it and break single-source-of-truth.

The heuristic to tell the two apart:

{.note}
**Is there already a `Schema` that defines this shape for validation or the wire?** If yes, it's
schema-backed data — derive the type. If no, it's a pure call contract — hand-write the interface.

``` ts
// ✅ good — the schema is the SSOT; the type derives from it
export const apiUsageMetrics = Schema.Struct({ /* … */ })
export type ApiUsageMetrics = typeof apiUsageMetrics.Type

// ✅ also good — a Schema.Class gives the named type directly (see Naming)
export class ApiUsageMetrics extends Schema.Class<ApiUsageMetrics>("ApiUsageMetrics")({ /* … */ }) {}
```

Keep such aliases rare: Effect exposes a schema's type through its `.Type` member at the use site
rather than proliferating standalone aliases — derive where you need it, don't mint a name for every
shape.

{#services-use-class-extends .must appliesTo="src examples"}
## Services, tags, and stores use the class-extends form

A service, HyperService tag, or app store is declared by extending the framework factory *in a
class* — never a bare factory call bound to a const. This is the **only** sanctioned `class extends`
in the codebase (see *Principles → Composition over inheritance*): you are not inheriting behaviour,
you are giving the service a **nominal identity**. The `<Self>` self-reference is what supplies it —
the class names itself as its own type.

``` ts
// core service — Context.Service<Self, Shape>, the Shape usually its own interface
export interface DurableWorkPoolStoreShape { /* … */ }
class DurableWorkPoolStore extends Context.Service<DurableWorkPoolStore, DurableWorkPoolStoreShape>()(
  "hyperlink-ts/DurableWorkPoolStore",
) {}

// HyperService tag — X.Tag
class Prices extends Daemon.Service<Prices>()("app/Prices", { success: priceSchema }) {}

// app journal — Store.Service + registrations (not a retired ProcessStore / LogStore facet)
class AppStore extends Store.Service<AppStore>("@app/Store")(
  Daemon.store(Prices),
) {}
```

``` ts
// ❌ bad — bare factory bound to a const: no self-type, no nominal identity
const durableWorkPoolStore = Context.Service(id, shape)
```

{.note}
Effect declares its services the same way — `class CurrentTimeZone extends
Context.Service<CurrentTimeZone, TimeZone>()(key)` — the self-reference is the identity.

Two facts live elsewhere so each stays in one place: **ids** are slash-scoped (*Naming*), and
**associated type helpers** attach via `export declare namespace` (*Module layout*).
