// Browser stub for @effect/platform-node (Node-only platform). Hyperlink.ts reaches it only

// transport DIES in a browser by design, and demo islands use in-memory resources) — but
// bundlers chase dynamic imports, so without this stub the client build tries to bundle
// node:fs/node:http/node:worker_threads. A Proxy no-op satisfies any namespace access; if a
// browser path ever actually CALLS into it, failing loudly here beats a phantom bundle.
