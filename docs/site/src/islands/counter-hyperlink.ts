// The `docs/Counter` HyperService — declared here, in a plain (non-"use client") module,
// so that when Waku re-imports the CounterIsland *entry* on a content hot-edit it does
// NOT re-declare the HyperService (the registry rejects a duplicate group id). The class is
// declared once; the island just imports these prebuilt atoms. This is the seam between
// "the service" and "the UI that drives it" — the same split a real app would make.
