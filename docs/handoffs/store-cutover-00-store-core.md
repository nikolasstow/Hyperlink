# Store cutover — Store core (shared decisions for all resource agents)

> **Naming:** read as WorkPool / Daemon / Gate / Hyperlink / hyperlink-ts (pre-rebrand names purged from this file).

**Read this first.** The Daemon / WorkPool / Gate / untyped WorkPool cutover reports all depend on
the decisions here. Companion to `result-schema-and-rpc-validation.md` (naming) and
`queue-persistence-design.md` (two-plane model).

## Done and on the integration branch

- **Store Stage 1 — default in-memory backing.** `layerDefaultMemory` (`Store.ts`,
  `buildDefaultScopeBridge`) provides {@link Storage} from one in-memory `EventJournal`, materializing
  any scope on demand. `store-default.test.ts` proves it. **This is the always-present default** — see the
  resolution decision below.
- **Precise handle resolution (tightening).** `bridge.at` is generic (`at<Input>(scopeKey, input)` →
  `StoreHandleOf<Input>`); `Tag.store` / `Hyperlink.store` / `AppStore.at(tag)` return the **precise**
  `Store.HandleOf<contract>`. Removes the consumer casts (see "Action for every module").
- **`Storage` public API** — {@link Storage}, {@link StorageApi}, and {@link layerDefaultMemory} are
  `@public` so third-party engines declare the bridge as a dependency (`withDefault` / `withStorage`).

## Decisions locked

### 1. The Store is a **defaulted service** — NEVER `serviceOption`

The store is **always in context**, exactly like `Clock` / `Logger` / `Random`: `layerDefaultMemory` is the
default (in-memory), a real `Store.Service` overrides it. So **there is no "is there a store?" question** —
and therefore **no `Effect.serviceOption(Storage)` anywhere, no `Option.match`, no no-op branch.**

- Engines resolve the store as a **plain declared dependency**: `yield* Storage` or
  `yield* Store.withDefault(scopeKey, contract)`. Because it is always provided, the `yield*` always succeeds.
- "No store wired" is not `Option.none` — it is the default implementation doing its thing.
- **Emit path never sniffs.** Resolve once (as a dependency), emit unconditionally.

**This also dissolves the deadlock.** Resolving the store via `serviceOption` *inside a layer build* races
a concurrent `AppStore.at(tag)` and locks the scoped `EventJournal` (verified on the queue). A **declared
dependency** is built in topological order and memoized, so the store builds first and every reader reuses
the same instance — no race, no forked-fiber trick, no lazy per-event resolution.

### 2. Provision — soft-default Memory (R fulfilled); override via provide

Toolkit `layer` / `serve` / `serveRemote` soft-default {@link Store.layerDefaultMemory} via
{@link Store.withDefaultStorage} — **R is fulfilled** out of the box (`*Memory` aliases same).

Override by feeding an app `Store.Service` **into** the toolkit layer so Soft unwrap captures it:

```ts
Daemon.layer(Tag, config).pipe(Layer.provideMerge(AppStore.layer({ filename })))
Hyperlink.httpServer([…]).pipe(Layer.provide(AppStore.layerMemory))
```

Sibling `Layer.merge(engine, AppStore)` does **not** override. Live recipe SSOT:
[`docs/guides/stores.md`](../guides/stores.md).

### 3. Tag is the SSOT for wire schemas (`payload`/`success`/`error`)

Engine/layer config may accept schemas *internally* (bootstrapping without a tag, tests), but must not
advertise schema overrides — overriding a tag's schema at `layer()` is unsafe for RPC
(`result-schema-and-rpc-validation.md` §3).

### 4. One `event` shape per resource store, tagged-union row, `record`/`events` handle

Persist the same event the live surface emits (queue: `QueueEvent<T>`; process: execution union; run:
fact/state union).

## Action for EVERY module

- **Cast removal.** With the tightening, `... as BuiltInXContract` is unnecessary. Mirror
  `builtInQueueStoreContract` (cast-free). ~~`processStoreSpec.ts` still has `... as BuiltInProcessContract`~~
  **Daemon:** factory cast removed — `record` accepts `DaemonStoreEventRow` via a narrow `event.append`
  bridge; journal encodes on append. Gate's contract likewise.
- **No `serviceOption` on `Storage`.** Resolve it as a declared dependency (§1). (`serviceOption`
  is still correct for the **durability** plane — `DurableWorkPoolStore` — and irrelevant for the legacy facets
  being deleted.)

## Who is currently wrong (2026-07-07)

- ~~**Gate** — `internal/gateStoreTap.ts` resolves with `serviceOption` + handle cast~~ **Fixed**
  on run-resource branch: declared `Storage` dependency, cast-free contract, **`GateStore` facet deleted**,
  `layerDefaultMemory` merged into layer entry points.
- ~~**Daemon** — still on `ProcessExecutionStore` only~~ **Fixed** on integration branch: `processStoreTap.ts`
  deleted, **`ProcessExecutionStore` facet deleted**, `withDefaultMemory` on toolkit layers.
- ~~**Queue** — engine still writes legacy `WorkPoolStore` facet~~ **Fixed** on `integration/storage`:
  `materializeEngineQueueStore*` + `publishEvent` → Store bridge; facet class deleted from `src/`.
- Legacy-facet `serviceOption` calls (`HistoryStore` / `WorkPoolStore` /
  `LogStore`) are being **deleted** in the cutover — not this rule's concern.
- Durability `serviceOption(DurableWorkPoolStore)` is **correct** — leave it.

### 5. Store event wire — `_tag`, `success`, `error` (locked 2026-07-07)

Persisted store rows use the **same slot names as the tag factory** (`success`, `error`) and
**PascalCase `_tag`** discriminators. Tag config and store wire align — no `result` on
`Completed`.

| Convention | Rule |
|------------|------|
| **`_tag`** / state-transition **`reason`** | PascalCase only — `Started`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Interrupted`, `Waiting`, `WaitInterrupted`, … Never kebab or dotted prefixes (`run-resource.run.failed`, `gate.run.started`). |
| **`success`** | Present on terminal success rows **iff** the tag declares a `success` schema. Field name is `success` (not `result`). Value is the **decoded** worker/run return — journal encodes on append. |
| **`error`** | Always on terminal failure rows. Presence-driven by the tag's `error` schema (see below). |

#### `error` encoding (locked — Daemon, WorkPool, Gate store rows)

One rule for all worker resources:

1. **Extract** the failure value once at the engine:
   `Option.getOrElse(Cause.findErrorOption(cause), () => Cause.squash(cause))`.
2. **Tag declares `error` schema** → store row carries **decoded typed `error`** (the fail-channel
   value). Pass the raw object to `store.record`; the contract's `error` field uses the tag schema;
   the journal **encodes on append** — never pre-encode to JSON/string at the tap.
3. **Tag has no `error` schema** → store row carries **`error: Schema.String`** with
   `String(extracted)` — human-readable fallback, not `Cause.pretty` of the full tree, not
   `Schema.Cause` on the wire.

Queue `Failed` without an `error` schema uses the same `error: string` field (not a separate
`cause` column on the persisted row). Live `.events` streams may still carry rich `Cause`/`Exit`
for subscribers; the **store row** follows the rule above.

**Not the live-handle `result` ref:** Daemon's reactive `result` Subscribable (latest success
`Option`) is unrelated — only the persisted `Completed.success` field follows this table.

## Store-core TODO

- [x] `success` persistence — terminal rows carry optional `success` when the tag stamps `success`.
- [x] `error` encoding — presence-driven typed vs `String` fallback (§5).

## Proposals (informational — owner approval required)

- **Layer query / bulk read** — draft design for multi-scope and whole-layer reads on EventJournal
  `Store`. **Not approved for implementation.** See [`store-layer-query.md`](./archive/2026-07/designs/store-layer-query.md).
  Store agent: refine or replace; do not ship public API without owner sign-off.
