# Agent 1 — Phase 1 plan: handoffs cleanup inventory

> **Naming:** read as WorkPool / Daemon / Gate / Hyperlink / hyperlink-ts (pre-rebrand names purged from this file).

**Status:** **BATCHES A–D EXECUTED** (2026-07-14) — owner unlock “do it all” / archive-first.  
**Owner steer:** thorough · precautionary · **defer edge cases / deletes / ambiguous moves to owner**.  
**Assignment:** [`agent-01-docs-corpus.md`](./agent-01-docs-corpus.md) Phase 1.  
**Branch:** `cursor/docs-corpus-phase1-archive-ce05`.  
**Scope:** `docs/handoffs/**` (+ link ripples in legacy / standards). **Out of scope:** `docs/site/**` UI, `src/web` / `src/ui`, Phases 2–3, batch **E** (SSOT layout), batch **Z** (deletes).

Inventory below remains the fate table. Soft asks → [`open-asks.md`](../features/open-asks.md).

---

## Locked execution rules (owner 2026-07-14)

1. **Archive ≫ delete.** First pass(es) = archive only. Deletes need per-row owner ticks.
2. **When unsure → leave in place** and list under **Deferred for owner** (do not invent fates).
3. **External citations block casual moves** — anything linked from `AGENTS.md`, `docs/legacy/**`, or `docs/site/README.md` stays put until a move PR also fixes those links **and** owner OK’d that batch.
4. **Active bus + open briefs** stay at root (`agent-status`, `owner-decisions`, `supervisor-protocol`, `local-agents`, live Agent 1/3/B/C/D files).
5. **Historical SSOT** (`*-decisions.md`, store-cutover set cited by STORAGE, etc.) stay at root until Phase 3 / explicit unlock.
6. Propose work as **batches**; owner says which batch to run.

---

## Proposed batches (awaiting unlock)

| Batch | What | Risk | Status |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| **0 — posture only** | This plan + owner-decisions steer | None | **done** |
| **A — date-stamped orphans** | Complete → delete (owner stack rule); unfinished → open-asks | Low | **done** — no `2026-*.md` left at root |
| **B — merged agent closeouts** | → `archive/2026-07/agents/` | Low–med | **done** |
| **C — shipped feature handoffs** | → `archive/2026-07/features/` (+ link rewrites) | Med | **done** |
| **D — reports bodies** | → `archive/2026-07/reports/`; keep `reports/README` | Higher ripple | **done** |
| **E — SSOT / store-cutover / decisions** | Design-lock: decisions stay flat; cutover SSOTs stay; archive closed Agent 3 plans + not-approved `store-layer-query` | High if moved wrong | **done (design-lock + small archive)** — 2026-07-14 |
| **Z — deletes** | Only ticked rows | Irreversible (git recoverable) | **still deferred** — archive-first holds |

---

## Deferred for owner (do not move without you)

- ~~Whether to use a root `decisions/` folder~~ → **locked flat** (alt A) 2026-07-14  
- ~~`store-cutover-*.md` + `store-and-logs-design.md` while STORAGE cites them~~ → **stay at root** until Phase 3  
- ~~`agent-03-logs-store-followers-plan.md` / `agent-03-log-store-tail-plan.md`~~ → **archived** 2026-07-14  
- ~~`store-layer-query.md`~~ → **archived** under `archive/2026-07/designs/` (banner kept)  
- `queue-persistence-design.md` — **historical SSOT** at root (cited by DurableWorkPoolStore)  
- `queue-nonserializable-items.md` — Phase 2 candidate → `docs/plans/` when P3 unlocked  
- Any **delete** candidates (Batch Z)  
- Letter-agent docs (`agent-b-plan`, docs-platform decision) linked from `docs/site/README.md`  

---

## Method

- Enumerated **94** markdown files under `docs/handoffs/` (88 root + 6 under `reports/`).
- Cross-checked **inbound links** from `AGENTS.md`, `docs/legacy/**`, `docs/standards/**`, live book roots, and in-handoffs refs.
- Classifications below remain **proposals** until a batch is unlocked.

---

## Proposed fate vocabulary

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **active** | Needed for open / parked work or the live supervisor bus. Stays at `handoffs/` root (or current role path). |
| **historical SSOT** | Shipped / locked decisions that remain citable. Prefer keep at root **or** move only with a one-line stub + link fix. |
| **archive** | Finished agent work, audits, date-stamped findings. Move under `handoffs/archive/…`; keep git history. |
| **delete** | Superseded noise or duplicate closeouts with no unique content once pointers exist. **Owner must approve each.** |

Default bias: **archive over delete** for anything that might explain a past PR.

---

### C. Decision / design SSOTs — prefer **historical SSOT**

| Path | Role | Fate | Evidence |
|------|------|------|----------|
| `multi-host-instances-decisions.md` | Multi-host locked decisions | **historical SSOT** | Referenced from legacy beta migration notes |
| `multi-host-instances.md` | Theoretical exploration | **archive** | Explicitly theoretical; decisions file is SSOT |
| `store-transforms-fullcapture-decisions.md` | Store transforms locked | **historical SSOT** | Marked shipped; useful for archaeology |
| `store-shape-streams-decisions.md` | Nested shapes / streams | **historical SSOT** | Stated approved; shape model still relevant |

| `whats-changed-2026-07-13.md` | Base-branch recap | **archive** after dated (or keep through July) | Orienting doc; eventually archive |
| `queue-nonserializable-items.md` | Low-priority TODO | **active** (backlog note) **or** **archive** | Explicit TODO — owner call |

### D. Merged agent closeouts — **archive**

| Path | Role | Fate | Evidence |
|------|------|------|----------|
| `agent-01-next-headlining-resource.md` | Headlining research | **archive** | Shipped Telemetry+ShardMap; Agent 1 moved |
| `agent-01-telemetry-prototype-and-shardmap.md` | Pitches | **archive** | Status implemented |
| `agent-01-session-2-storage-docs.md` | Storage docs sweep | **archive** | Session done |
| `agent-01-store-cutover-closeout.md` | Store close-out | **archive** | Checkboxes done |

| `agent-cursor-logs-store-cutover.md` | Logs store cutover (Cursor) | **archive** or **delete** | Superseded by Agent 3 followers / #40/#43 — prefer archive + “superseded by …” |

| `agent-engine-handle-display-types.md` | Engine display types | **archive** | Overlaps Agent D / type-display |

| `process-store-cutover-review.md` | Daemon cutover review | **archive** | Done |
| `run-resource-hardening-review.md` | Gate review | **archive** | Done |

### E. Date-stamped findings / wow-sports / beta audits — **first stack**

Owner rule (2026-07-14): one stack at a time; **complete → delete**, unfinished → **defer**.

| Path | Fate |
|------|------|
| Date-stamped `2026-*.md` stack | **closed** — deletes + open-asks absorbs; beta22 handoff deleted (PipeableTag fix + type hygiene) |
| [`open-asks.md`](../features/open-asks.md) | **active** — §1 widget seam · §2 when-not-to-hoist · §3 layerNoop |

### F. Feature handoffs superseded by shipped API — **archive** (default)

| Path | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `api-resource-metrics.md` | ApiMetrics | Shipped |
| `custom-queue-resource.md` | untyped WorkPool | Shipped |
| `docs-twoslash-hover-types.md` | Twoslash types | Lettered/site; archive — **do not edit site** |
| `docs-updates.md` | Misc docs agent | Archive |
| `resource-host-health.md` | Host health | Host→Node rename era; archive |
| `resource-serverentry-for-custom-resources.md` | serverEntry report | Archive |
| `serve-apimetrics-with-group.md` | Serve ApiMetrics | Archive |
| `serveallhttp-heterogeneous-requirements.md` | serveAllHttp R pin | Archive |
| `ui-serve-all-http.md` | UI agent serveAllHttp | Archive; linked from legacy setup guide — fix link on move |
| `withreadiness-host-bound-tags.md` | withReadiness report | Archive |

### G. `reports/` bus — **keep index; archive bodies**

| Path | Fate |
|------|------|
| `reports/README.md` | **active** (index) — update after moves |
| `reports/2026-07-07-agent-report-*.md` (5) | **archive** → `archive/2026-07/reports/` **or** keep under `reports/archive/` |
| External links | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/legacy/AGENTS.md`, PACKAGE-GUIDE, STORAGE, PROCESS-API, process guide cite reports — **must rewrite** on move |

### H. Candidates for **delete** (need owner checkbox)

Only if archive is unwanted:

| Path | Why delete might be OK | Safer alternative |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Duplicate closeouts once stubs exist in `whats-changed` / LOGS | Reduce noise | Archive month folder |
| Withdrawn Cursor logs-store-cutover after Agent 3 supersession note in status | One-liner in status enough | Archive |
| Pure duplicate “report” once folded into agent report | — | Archive |

**Recommendation:** Phase 1 execution = **zero deletes** unless owner ticks specific rows. Prefer `archive/`.

## 2. Proposed tree

```
docs/handoffs/
  README.md                         # NEW (optional): how to read this bus
  agent-status.md                   # forever
  owner-decisions.md                # forever
  supervisor-protocol.md            # forever
  local-agents.md                   # forever
  agent-01-docs-corpus.md           # active track
  agent-01-docs-corpus-phase1-plan.md
  agent-03-*.md                     # while Agent 3 open
  agent-d-named-handles.md
  agent-b-*.md / agent-c-*.md       # while plan-first

    2026-07/
      reports/                      # optional nest
      agents/                       # optional: retired agent-0x closeouts
```

### Alternative (owner pick)

**A (recommended):** Flat root for *live + SSOT*; everything else under `archive/YYYY-MM/`.  
**B:** Also add `handoffs/decisions/` for `*-decisions.md` (cleaner root; more link churn).  
**C:** Delete aggressively after inventory — smallest tree; highest risk of losing rationale.

---

## 3. Keep-forever rules (root)

Stay at `docs/handoffs/` root **forever** (until the bus itself is redesigned):

1. `agent-status.md`
2. `owner-decisions.md`
3. `supervisor-protocol.md`
4. `local-agents.md` (or merge into supervisor-protocol later — owner call)
5. The **current** Agent 1 corpus assignment file while this track is open
6. Any brief listed on the status board as **plan-first / building / active**
7. Decision files still cited by **live** or **legacy-served** documentation (`STORAGE.md`, process/store guides, `docs/site/README.md`) until Phase 3 ports those citations into the live book

Everything else is eligible for archive once:

- Status header says merged/done/shipped, **and**
- Not in the external link set below (or links updated in the same PR).

---

## 4. Link-ripple check (must fix in same PR as moves)

### High priority (outside `handoffs/`)

| Source | Targets |
|--------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | `handoffs/reports/README.md` |
| `docs/legacy/AGENTS.md` | reports README + docs-release report |
| `docs/legacy/PACKAGE-GUIDE.md`, `README.md`, `PROCESS-API.md`, `STORAGE.md` | reports README; store-cutover-\*; result-schema |
| `docs/legacy/guides/store.md`, `store-backing.md` | `store-and-logs-design.md` |
| `docs/legacy/guides/process.md` | process agent report; store-cutover-daemon |
| `docs/legacy/guides/setup.md` | `ui-serve-all-http.md` |
| `docs/site/README.md` | `agent-b-plan.md`, `docs-platform-architecture-decision.md` (**lettered agents own site** — Agent 1 only fixes the markdown link text/path, does not change site chrome) |

### Medium

- In-handoffs: `agent-status.md` links to almost every active brief — update after each move.
- `owner-decisions.md` → corpus / Agent 3 briefs.
- Cross-links among store-cutover-\* and reviews.

### Low / none today

- Many date-stamped `2026-07-01-*` files have **zero** inbound links → cheapest archive class.
- DynamicConfig handoffs currently unlinked from legacy → archive without ripple.

### Daemon for execution PR(s)

1. Owner approves fate table (maybe with edits).  
2. One PR: create `archive/…`, `git mv` only **archive** rows, fix ripples, update `reports/README` + `agent-status`.  
3. Optional second PR: any **delete** rows owner checked.  
4. Do **not** touch `docs/site/src/**`.

---

## 5. Out of scope (hard)

- `docs/site/**` UI, CSS, Twoslash popover, dual-preview, Vite globs, Draft badge chrome  
- `src/web`, `src/ui`, dashboard widgets  
- Phase 2 (`docs/plans/`, plans refactor)  
- Phase 3 (legacy → live book + Draft content convention)  
- Engine / Logs / handles product code  
- Mass delete in this plan turn  

---

## 6. Open questions for owner (discussion)

1. **Archive vs delete default?** Plan recommends archive-only for first execution.  
2. **`decisions/` subdirectory?** Cleaner root vs more link churn (alt B).  
3. **Keep all `store-cutover-*.md` at root until STORAGE.md is rewritten in Phase 3?** Recommended yes.  
4. **`agent-03-logs-store-followers-plan.md`:** keep active (still cited) vs archive now that #40/#43 landed?  
5. **`store-layer-query.md`:** leave as parked-not-approved at root, or archive with banner?  
6. **`reports/`:** keep folder + index forever, only archive the five dated reports?  
7. Branch name: brief suggested `cursor/docs-handoffs-cleanup-a009`; this plan branch is `cursor/docs-corpus-phase1-plan-ce05` — rename on execute unlock if you care.

---

## 7. Counts (this inventory)

| Fate (proposed) | Approx count |
|-----------------|-------------:|
| active (bus + open agents) | ~15–20 |
| historical SSOT | ~12–15 |
| archive | ~55–60 |
| delete (optional) | 0 in first pass |

Exact counts will be locked when you annotate the tables.

---

## Stop

**Batches A–E done** (archive-first; E = design-lock + closed/not-approved archive).  
**Z** still needs per-row delete ticks.  
Next: Phase 2 — [`agent-01-docs-corpus-phase2-plan.md`](./agent-01-docs-corpus-phase2-plan.md).
