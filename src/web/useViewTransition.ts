/**
 * @module web/useViewTransition
 *
 * Animate a navigation state change with the browser's **View Transitions API** instead of
 * cutting. The key idea is **conditional naming**: only the element you're navigating
 * to/from carries a `view-transition-name` during a given transition, so it morphs while
 * everything else is captured as one image and grows/fades together. (If every card were
 * always named, each would be lifted out and animate independently — the new grid's cards
 * would pop in at their final spots instead of growing with the page.)
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ViewTransitionProvider>…app…</ViewTransitionProvider>
 *
 * const transition = useViewTransition();
 * // card: named only while it (res-<id>) is the active transition
 * <button style={useViewTransitionStyle(`res-${tag.key}`)}
 *         onClick={() => transition(`res-${tag.key}`, () => setSelected(tag))} />
 * // detail container shares the name → the card morphs into it
 * <div style={useViewTransitionStyle(`res-${tag.key}`)} />
 * ```
 *
 * Degrades to an instant update where the API is unavailable, and honors
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` via the consumer's `::view-transition-*` CSS.
 *
