/**
 * @module Group
 *
 * `Group.Service` — an organization tool. A real Context tag (built on `Context.Service`,
 * like `Hyperlink.Service`) that holds named member tags. Pass a record; each member becomes
 * an accessor on the class, full tag intact.
 *
 *   class MyGroup extends Group.Service<MyGroup>("@pkg/MyGroup")({
 *     Counter,
 *     QueueManager,
 *   }) {}
 *
 *   MyGroup.Counter         // the Counter tag, name intact
 *   MyGroup.members         // { Counter, QueueManager }
 *   Group.members(MyGroup)  // same, via the namespace
 *
 * Groups nest like any other tag: a member can itself be a `Group.Service`, and because
 * you pass it in under a name, the name is preserved.
 *
 *   class Ops extends Group.Service<Ops>("@pkg/Ops")({
 *     Web,            // a HyperService tag
 *     Jobs: MyGroup,  // a child group — nesting is free
 *   }) {}
 *
 *   Ops.Jobs.Counter  // reach into the nested group
 *
 * Consume as a tree-shakeable module namespace: `import * as Group from
 * "hyperlink-ts/Group"` (or `{ Group }` from the barrel).
