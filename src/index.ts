/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * **hyperlink-ts** — Effect Hyperlink: location-transparent **services** for Effect (WorkPool,
 * Daemon, Gate, stores, logs, dashboards).
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## What this package provides
 *
 * - **`Daemon`**, **`Polling`** — Build a **managed daemon** with a trigger-driven runtime: a
 *   long-lived driver follows a schedule and spawns run instances; each instance checks its
 *   schedule and exits naturally when disarmed while `Polling` controls in-instance repeat cadence.
 *   Optional `polling` / `schedule` layers on `Daemon.make` are merged into the daemon effect so
 *   fork-time requirements stay accurate in TypeScript. Run windows are built with
 *   `Daemon.scheduleInMemory` / `scheduleDefine` (and the toolkit `Daemon.Schedule` resource /
 *   `Daemon.window` / `Daemon.at`).
 * - **`WorkPool`** — Three-level **priority** queues with **concurrency** and optional
 *   **`rateLimit`** (Effect `RateLimiter`); each queue is a **Context**
 *   service with a `.layer`. `WorkPool.priority` adds named N-lane queues.
 * - **`Store`** — EventJournal-backed execution / queue / gate / log history; daemon stores via
 *   `Daemon.store(tag)` and `Store.Service`.
 * - **Toolkit (location-transparent services)** — **`Hyperlink`** is the foundation: a service is
 *   driven by the same `yield* Service` code whether it runs **local or remote** (`Hyperlink.client` /
 *   `serve` / `serveRemote` / `Node` switch only the layer). Batteries-included kinds build on it —
 *   `Daemon.Service` / `Daemon.Schedule` and `WorkPool.Service` / `WorkPool.priority` — each with
 *   `Service` / `layer` / `configure` / `serve` / `serveRemote` (baked config+layer factories are
 *   `*.define`). **`Group`** organizes member services
 *   (nestable; members may be on the same or different nodes). Contracts are introspectable via
 *   `specOf` + `methodMeta` (build generic UIs). See the live book under `docs/services/` and
 *   `docs/guides/`.
 * - **`Gate`**, **`HttpClientGate`**, **`Gate.HttpApiClient`** —
 *   Optional building blocks for **gated** HTTP and reusable service patterns.
 * - **Persistence** — `DurableWorkPoolStore` (durable priority queue) + `HistoryStore`
 *   (metrics/logs history); in-memory or SQLite (`hyperlink-ts/storage/sqlite`).
 *
 * ## Where to read next
 *
 * - Live book: `docs/index.md`, `docs/services/`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/standards/`
 * - Logs: `docs/guides/logs.md` (and `docs/LOGS.md` while the guide absorbs it)
 * - Runnable teaching scripts: `examples/README.md`
 * - Future roadmap (priority order, **not** shipped API truth): `docs/plans/README.md`
 * - Agent / supervisor bus: `docs/handoffs/agent-status.md`
 *
 * ## Import style
 *
 * Every public API lives under a **namespace** in its source module
 * (`HyperlinkConfigure`, `Store`, …). The root barrel re-exports the same bindings under
 * short names where useful.
 *
 * ## Dedicated subpaths
 *
 * Service/resource subpaths mirror namespaces: **`hyperlink-ts/Daemon`**,
 * **`hyperlink-ts/WorkPool`**, **`hyperlink-ts/HyperlinkConfigure`**,
 * **`hyperlink-ts/Store`**, and **`hyperlink-ts/Logs`**.
 *
 * Toolkit subpaths: **`hyperlink-ts/Hyperlink`** (foundation + `specOf` / `methodMeta`),
 * **`hyperlink-ts/WorkPool`** (toolkit queue),
 * **`hyperlink-ts/MultiNode`** (multi-instance gather/fold),
 * **`hyperlink-ts/Group`**,
 * **`hyperlink-ts/HistoryStore`**,
 * and **`hyperlink-ts/DurableWorkPoolStore`**.
 *
 * Durable logs: register `Node.logs` / toolkit `*.store(tag)` on a {@link Store.Service}
 * (`layerMemory` / `layer` bake in capture + per-registration tails). Capture/relay:
 * `hyperlink-ts/Logs`.
 *
 * Durable adapters: **`hyperlink-ts/storage/sqlite`**
 * (`SQLiteDurableWorkPoolStore`, `SQLiteHistoryStore`).
 *
 * ## Source-only helpers
 *
 * The published **`exports["."]`** surface is this file. Small utilities (`utcDate`, etc.)
 * live under `src/` for tests and tooling; they are not part of the semver API unless promoted
 * here.
 *
 * **Layers in `src/`:** Prefer attaching dependencies via **built {@link Context.Context}**
 * (`Effect.provide(effect, context)`) inside the runtime, or **`ManagedRuntime`** at true OS
 * edges. Avoid scattering {@link Effect.provide} with
 * {@link Layer.Layer} through library internals — examples attach a **single** composed layer
 * at script entry (`examples/shared/demo-harness.ts`, same idea as `@effect/platform-node`
 * samples). **Tests** may use `Effect.provide` with layers, matching Effect’s own suites.
