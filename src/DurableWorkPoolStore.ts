/**
 * **DurableWorkPoolStore** — the *durability plane* of a `WorkPool`: a priority-native store of
 * pending + in-flight work, so no enqueued item is lost across a restart (**at-least-once** +
 * dedup key). This is the abstract port; backends live behind it (SQLite today —
 * `hyperlink-ts/storage/sqlite`). Inspired by Effect's `PersistedQueue` (we lift its
 * lease / `attempts` / expiry-recovery blueprint) but priority-native, not FIFO — see
 * `docs/handoffs/queue-persistence-design.md`.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the *observability plane* ({@link HistoryStore} — metrics/logs
 * history): durability is the hot-path source of truth (tiny, fast, scan-pending boot),
 * observability is fat append-only history off the hot path. You can run either alone.
 *
 * Semantics — **at-least-once + dedup key**: on crash, in-flight (lease-expired) entries are
 * redelivered; supply a `dedupKey` (or write an idempotent effect) to avoid double work.
