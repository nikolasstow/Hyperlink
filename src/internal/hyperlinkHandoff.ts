 * `from` is the local service handle, `to` is a peer client of the same HyperService (dialed
 * from the Directory, self excluded by dial), and `ctx` exposes the outcome Effects
 * ({@link hyperlinkHandoffContext}). Returning `void` (or `ctx.done`) succeeds; `ctx.retry`
 * re-runs the function (bounded); `ctx.defer` — or any failure / defect — leaves the node up
 * and surfaces {@link HandoffDeferred} to the shutdown caller.
