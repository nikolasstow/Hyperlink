/**
 * Resolves the server's `$HOME`, once, for expanding a `~/`-prefixed root
 * folder. Confirmed hands-on: the file API's `directory` param is a literal
 * filesystem path — passing it `~/Coding` isn't shorthand there, it's just
 * a directory named `~` that doesn't exist, and the server 500s. The
 * browser has no OS access to expand it itself, so this asks the
 * `repo-admin` agent (already the one narrow, permission-scoped agent
 * agent-console uses for anything shell-adjacent — see worktree.ts) to
 * read it server-side, once, and caches the result for the page's lifetime.
