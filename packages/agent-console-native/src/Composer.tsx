/**
 * The real, editable composer bar — used both at the bottom of a chat
 * session and on Home. One component rather than a copy per screen: the
 * glass/`Host` behavior below is full of hard-won ordering and timing
 * constraints (see the modifier-order note on CHIP_BUTTON_MODIFIERS, and
 * the glassEffect finding above it), and every one of those would have to
 * be fixed twice if this were duplicated. Screens vary it through props —
 * `placeholder`, and `topSection` for extra content inside the bubble
 * above the input (Home uses that for its repo/worktree/branch pickers;
 * chat passes nothing).
 *
 * One persistent element for its whole lifetime — a single `GlassView`
 * wrapping a `TextInput` that's always mounted, never a decoy tree swapped
 * for a real one. An earlier version split "idle" and "editing" into two
 * mutually exclusive component trees, matching HomeComposerBar's own decoy
 * pill when idle (that component has since been removed — Home renders
 * this same Composer now) and swapping to a `TextInput` + a separate
 * controls row once focused/typed into. That produced a long run of native-bridge bugs
 * — `Host`'s SwiftUI content and `GlassView`'s glass material both turned
 * out to only reliably initialize once, on a component's genuine first
 * mount, with no clean signal or supported hook for "this instance got
 * reused, redo your setup." Every one of the earlier fixes (forcing a
 * fresh touch target with an explicit `Pressable`, delaying icon mounts
 * until layout settled, cycling `glassEffectStyle` through an intermediate
 * value, forcing a new React `key` on every reopen) was working around
 * that same root cause from a different angle — worth doing only because
 * the tree was swapping in the first place. With nothing ever unmounting,
 * none of it is needed: `GlassView`'s effect sets up exactly once, for
 * real, and stays set up for as long as the composer exists.
 *
 * Two sections, not two components — an `inputSection` holding the
 * `TextInput` alone (grows upward with content, collapses to 0 height
 * *and* 0 opacity when idle) and a `controlsRow` that's always visible,
 * always the same height, never collapsing. `expanded` gates the input
 * section's collapse via `LayoutAnimation` triggered from the
 * `TextInput`'s own `onFocus`/`onBlur` — the one mechanism confirmed
 * (against the exact commit where it worked, byte-for-byte) to reliably
 * drive that animation; `onContentSizeChange` alone isn't enough.
 *
 * `controlsRow` is three parts: a fixed `+` button on the left, a fixed
 * send button on the right, and a flexible `pickerSlot` that absorbs
 * whatever space is left. Because +/send live in their own fixed-width
 * slots in a row whose height never depends on the `TextInput`, there's
 * no cross-axis alignment tension to fight (a shared `mainRow` with
 * `alignItems: "center"`/`"flex-end"` was tried — both are compromises,
 * since the `TextInput` was often that row's tallest, variable-height
 * child). `controlsRow`'s own `paddingTop` only exists to separate it
 * from the grown input above it, so it's zeroed out alongside
 * `inputSection`'s own collapse — otherwise it's dead space sitting above
 * the buttons with nothing above them to separate from.
 *
 * +/send are real native SwiftUI `Button`s (background circle, glass
 * effect, and SF Symbol all one native element via `@expo/ui`) — each in
 * its own `Host`, sized by an explicit `style` (`chipHost`/
 * `sendChipHost`), not `matchContents`. `glassEffect` is confirmed
 * load-bearing, not decorative: swapping it for `background(color,
 * shapes.circle())` — everything else held constant — broke the delayed-
 * alignment bug immediately (see `CHIP_BUTTON_MODIFIERS`'s own comment).
 * Flat/non-glass native buttons aren't achievable here without
 * reintroducing that bug; the attempt is saved as the `d49b883fc` WIP
 * commit on this branch, not lost. Auto's own chevron stays on `Feather`
 * (`@expo/vector-icons`) — it's not wired to a real dropdown yet, and was
 * never part of this native-button work.
 *
 * `pickerSlot` holds two always-mounted, absolutely-stacked children —
 * the model picker and a single-line mirror of the `TextInput`'s own
 * value/placeholder — cross-faded by opacity/`pointerEvents` on
 * `expanded`, never conditionally rendered. Tapping the mirror focuses
 * the real (currently 0-height) `TextInput` via a ref; the collapsed
 * bubble reads as one compact pill (`+`, mirrored text, send) without
 * ever being a decoy standing in for the real input the way the old
 * two-tree design was — the `TextInput` itself is what's collapsed, not
 * swapped out. Home's `topSection` (repo/worktree/branch menus) collapses
 * the same way — only visible while expanded.
 *
 * Attachment ("+") is still a stub. Model selection is real —
 * `client.provider.list()`, passed through on every send (new session and
 * mid-chat). The label is the model name, not “Auto” (Cursor’s routing
 * feature; we pick an explicit connected model).
