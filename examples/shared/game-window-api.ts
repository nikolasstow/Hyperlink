/**
 * @module examples/shared/game-window-api
 *
 * **Test double** for “we polled an external **game schedule** API and learned when the match
 * is **live** vs **finished**”. Shared by schedule / polling game-window demos.
 *
 * ### Scripted timeline (simulated ms, under **`TestClock`**)
 *
 * | Phase | Simulated delay (cumulative) | What happens to schedule state |
 * |-------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
 * | Pre-game | **0 → 800** | no active schedule entry — no daemon ticks. |
 * | Kickoff | at **800** | entry opens — daemon may poll your `effect`. |
 * | Live window | **800 → 2000** | entry active — ticks run per **`Polling`**. |
 * | Full time | at **2000** | entry closes — ticks stop; driver stays alive until **`DaemonGroup.stop`**. |
 *
 * ### Production swap-in
 *
 * Replace this `Effect.gen` with a loop: **`HttpClient.request`** → parse JSON → compare
 * **`Date` / ISO strings** and update your schedule entries (`set` / `add` / `clear`).
 * Run it as its own supervised fiber or merge into your app **`Layer`**.
