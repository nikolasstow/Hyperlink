/**
 * @module examples/apps/cli/counter-cli
 *
 * A runnable CLI built from a single `Hyperlink` tag with a local layer — the
 * resource runs in-process. Swap `Hyperlink.layer` for an RPC client layer later
 * to drive a running server; the command tree is unchanged.
 *
 *   tsx examples/apps/cli/counter-cli.ts counter current
 *   tsx examples/apps/cli/counter-cli.ts counter increment --by 5
 *   tsx examples/apps/cli/counter-cli.ts --help
 *
 * Bare `counter` (no action) needs `hyperlink-ts/tui`'s layer — this example is CLI-only.
