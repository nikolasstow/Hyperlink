/**
 * @module examples/apps/queue-widget/queue-atoms
 *
 * Build the live-read + control atoms for a queue tag, once. Native Effect-4
 * atoms on an `Atom.runtime(layer)`; the layer is the seam (a real local queue
 * now, an RPC-backed client layer later).
 *
 * Typed against the public {@link WorkPool} handle — the product surface
 * (`yield* MyQueue` hovers as `WorkPool<…>`), not the internal engine handle.
 *
 * `stats` is a read atom keyed for refresh; mutations carry the same key, so any
 * command (and, in the demo, each worker completion) refreshes it — event-driven,
 * never polled. When the handle gains `changes: Stream<Snapshot>`, `stats`
 * becomes `runtime.atom(handle.changes)` and it's fully live with no keys at all.
